# OpenShift Pipelines

OpenShift Pipelines is a Kubernetes-style CI/CD solution based on Tekton. OpenShift Pipelines is designed to run each 
step of the CI/CD pipeline in its own container providing scalable cloud-native CI/CD pipelines. By leveraging in 
OpenShift,  pipelines are an automated process that drives software through a path of building, testing, and deploying 
code.
